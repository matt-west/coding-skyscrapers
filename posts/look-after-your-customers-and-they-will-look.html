		<p>I don&rsquo;t claim to be an expert in business, but in my relatively short adventure into the wonders of the business world I have noticed something that scares me. Existing and previous customers are severely neglected!<br />Here&rsquo;s a (slightly exaggerated) example:<br />&ldquo;Buy our new product and we&rsquo;ll give a brand new boat!&rdquo;<br />Small print:<br />&ldquo;New customers only&rdquo;</p>
		<p>So this example may be a little exaggerated but the principal is right. Most businesses use things like discounts and promotions to get customer&rsquo;s &lsquo;through the door&rsquo; and who can blame them, after all no customers = an exponential increase in accountant anger. The problem is that you don&rsquo;t see these promotions being offered to existing customers, so where did all the love go?</p>
		<p>My company is mainly based in the web design industry and so most of my customers will have a website built and then go on there way. There are areas of repeat business (hosting, domains, etc..) but the bulk of the sales are one-off items. So some people would argue what&rsquo;s the point in spending time and effort trying to keep your old customers happy when they&rsquo;re not likely to buy from you again. There&rsquo;s a really big point, referrals!</p>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been in business for about 12 months now (8 full-time) and a good chunk of my new business is now coming through referrals from old customers. It&rsquo;s an essential source of income for my business and it will only happen if I keep my old customers happy.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately in a world driven by sales targets and performance tables it&rsquo;s easy for this vital group of customers to be forgotten. However I have a theory that can keep&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;of your customers happy and improve your sales figures at the same time.</p>
		<p>The theory is that your old customers have the power to bring in more customers than you or your sales team. Really it&rsquo;s more of a fact than a theory. If you keep your old customers happy and you provided them with a good service they will recommend you to their friends, family and colleagues. These people then come to your door with a positive image of you and your products already set in their mind. In effect your old customers are like a massive sales force for your company, bringing in clients from all sorts of different backgrounds.<br />With some effort to make sure that you are going above and beyond to keep&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;of your clients happy the effect will snowball and before you know it 3 of your original customers have brought in 30 new customers!</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s common sense really but so many people get this so epically wrong.</p>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a few pointers as to what you can do to keep your old customers happy, here&rsquo;s some of the things I do:</p>
		<ol>
		<li style="padding: 0px;"><strong>Keep in touch:</strong>&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have to ring them every week, once every couple of months is fine. Just to see how they&rsquo;re getting on with their [website]. It&rsquo;d not designed to be a sales call so don&rsquo;t make it one.</li>
		<li style="padding: 0px;"><strong>Ask for feedback:</strong>&nbsp;A simple questionnaire or a couple of questions on the phone would do the trick. I would emphasise that a questionnaire should be brief, no more than 5 questions. Nobody will fill it in if you send them 4 pages of questions! If you do need to ask quite a few questions split the questions up and send them out to different groups.</li>
		<li style="padding: 0px;"><strong>Listen to their feedback:</strong>&nbsp;This is the most important one! There&rsquo;s no point asking for feedback if you&rsquo;re not going to act on it.</li>
		<li style="padding: 0px;"><strong>Thank them if they refer someone:</strong>&nbsp;A simple phone call or email to thank someone for referring a someone can go a long way. It let&rsquo;s them know that you appreciate them and value them as a customer.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This is the end of today&rsquo;s ramble I hope I haven&rsquo;t bored you too much. Remember:<br /><em>&ldquo;Look after your customers and they will look after you&rdquo;</em></p>
