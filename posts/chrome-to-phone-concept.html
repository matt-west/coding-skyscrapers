		<p>A Google engineer created the original&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chrometophone/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6600;">chrometophone</a>&nbsp;android app whilst on a plane. The app allows you to send the web page that you are viewing in your Chrome browser to the browser of you android powered device. The services uses&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/android/c2dm/index.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6600;">Cloud 2 Device Messaging</a>&nbsp;(C2DM) partnered with an web service hosted on app engine to send messages directly to a users device. The user first has to register their device with the chrometophone service.</p>
		<p>This service works really well but currently doesn&rsquo;t allow you to send the web page you are viewing on your phone back to the Chrome browser on your desktop.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately the&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/android/c2dm/index.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6600;">C2DM</a>&nbsp;service doesn&rsquo;t allow you to send messages back to the browser (as far as I know). Therefore I propose using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/websockets/basics/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6600;">web sockets</a>&nbsp;(with a long-polling fall back) to create a connection between the Chrome browser and the web server. An android app would then post a message to the web server (through the &lsquo;share&rsquo; menu) which would be routed to the user&rsquo;s Chrome browser.</p>
		<p>The user would need to authenticate the app using OAuth or similar service on both the mobile device and in Chrome. When chrome is opened an extension would establish a connection with the web server and wait for any messages (URLs) to display. This has the disadvantage that the browser must be open before posting the URL from the user&rsquo;s device however at this point in time I do not have a solution to this problem (short of some native client running on the users machine).</p>
		<p>Below is a diagram of how the service would work.</p>

		<p>This is currently just an idea however I will try and get a prototype working this weekend. For now I am just mind-dumping the idea here. If you are interested in getting involved with the coding get in touch (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MattAntWest" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6600;">@MattAntWest</a>).</p>
