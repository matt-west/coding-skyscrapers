		<p>I have,&nbsp;unfortunately,&nbsp;seriously&nbsp;neglected this blog recently as I&rsquo;ve been busy with work and all sorts of other exciting things.</p>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been asked to take over the management of the open source project <a href="http://simpleinvoices.org" title="Simple Invoices" target="_blank">Simple Invoices</a>&nbsp;which was a great surprise. I&rsquo;m pretty excited about this though and I&rsquo;ve got loads of ideas about how we can make the project even more awesome than it already is.&nbsp;The project is now about six years old and so taking charge at this point is pretty challenging, but then again I&rsquo;ve always loved a good challenge.</p>
		<p>As well as spending a lot of time working on Simple Invoices I&rsquo;m also experimenting with WebSockets and GO (my new favourite programming language). I&rsquo;ve managed to create a real-time chat as an example of what can be done, this was achieved with a lot of help from Gary Burd&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://gary.beagledreams.com/page/go-websocket-chat" target="_blank">WebSockets and GO</a>&rdquo; tutorial.</p>
		<p>I&rsquo;ll try and update this blog a lot more frequently in the future but for now peace out.</p>
