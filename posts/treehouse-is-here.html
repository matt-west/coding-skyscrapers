			The online 'webucation' site <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com" title="Treehouse" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> was launched today at FOWD New York. I've been eagerly anticipating the launch for the last few months ever since I heard <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ryancarson" title="Ryan Carson">Ryan Carson</a> speaking about it on <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/podcast/" title="Think Vitamin Radio">Think Vitamin Radio</a>. This afternoon I finaly got to explore treehouse and boy is it good. The first time I logged in I got that feeling of excitement that you get when you power up your Mac for the first time.

			It is very obvious that the team has spent a lot of time perfecting the way that the site is structured. It took me about 30 seconds to get from sign up to viewing my first video. All the interfaces are very intuitive and incredibly pleasing on the eye, just what you would expect from a <a href="http://mikekus.com/" title="Mike Kus">Mike Kus</a> design. I especially like the <a href="http://mailchimp.com" title="MailChimp">MailChimp</a> style 'tidbits' from the little mascot in the corner.

			You can earn 'badges' to prove that you know your stuff when it comes to various topics. When I first heard about this I was a little sceptical as I thought that it would probably be pretty easy to just breeze through the questions without watching the videos. This is not the case. The quiz questions are pretty in depth and get technical which is great as it means that the 'badges' system actually works, unlike in so many other websites where badges are pretty meaningless.

			Of course there are a few minor bugs here and there as can be expected with any new site but these will be resolved in time.

			A job well done for all Treehouse team!
