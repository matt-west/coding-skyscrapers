<p>A little while ago&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6600;">Google</a>&nbsp;released an experimental response to the security and performance issues that plague&nbsp;<span class="caps">DNS</span>&nbsp;services today. <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6600;">Google Public&nbsp;<span class="caps">DNS</span></a>&nbsp;leverages the power of Google&rsquo;s infrastructure in order to take the pressure of ISPs&rsquo;&nbsp;<span class="caps">DNS</span>&nbsp;services and help to provide better all-round experience to end users.</p>
<p>When Google&rsquo;s search engine crawls the web it caches large amounts of&nbsp;<span class="caps">DNS</span>&nbsp;information and by utilising this information Google Public<span class="caps">DNS</span>&nbsp;can help to serve lookups faster than many other&nbsp;<span class="caps">DNS</span>&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>I only heard about this service earlier today and thought it sounded promising so I gave it a go. After making some very quick adjustments to my network settings I was up and running and wow&hellip; The performance increase was more than noticeable, it was incredible! Obviously there are a lot of factors that come in to play when examining the speed of your browsing experience but the difference was too massive to dismiss the performance boost as coincidence.</p>
<p>If you are interested in trying this out you can find instructions on how to get set up as well as a lot of really interesting information abut the service on the&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6600;">Google Public&nbsp;<span class="caps">DNS</span>&nbsp;website</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some instructions for Ubuntu users. I&rsquo;m currently using 11.04 beta (which is awesome by the way) but they are pretty generic for most versions of Ubuntu.</p>
<p>1. Go to&nbsp;<strong>System Settings</strong><br />2. Click on&nbsp;<strong>Network Connections</strong><br />3. Select the connection that you use (You will need to repeat the following steps for each connection e.g. wired, wireless, etc)<br />4. Click&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong><br />5. Now click on the&nbsp;<strong>IPv4 Settings</strong>&nbsp;tab<br />6.&nbsp;<strong>Write down the existing settings!</strong>&nbsp;(just in case things don&rsquo;t go according to plan)<br />7. Change the &lsquo;method&rsquo; to&nbsp;<strong>Automatic (<span class="caps">DHCP</span>) addresses only</strong><br />8. In &lsquo;<span class="caps">DNS</span>&nbsp;Servers&rsquo; enter:&nbsp;<strong>8.8.8.8&nbsp;8.8.4.4</strong>&nbsp;(there should be a space between the two addresses).<br />9. Click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;and enter your password if prompted.</p>
<p>You can check to see if your system is configured correctly using the following command:<br /><code>sudo traceroute -n -w 2 -q 2 -m 30 8.8.8.8</code></p>
<p>The last line of the output should contain 8.8.8.8, if it doesn&rsquo;t check out the troubleshoot info&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using.html#testing" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff6600;">here</a>.</p>
<p>You might need to install traceroute which can be done using the following command:<br /><code>sudo apt-get install traceroute</code></p>
<p>I would add that this is an &lsquo;experimental service&rsquo; so be prepared to have to switch back if it is discontinued. If you have any questions post them in the comments below and I&rsquo;ll do my best to answer them.</p>
