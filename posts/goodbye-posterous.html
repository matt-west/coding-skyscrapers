			After hearing news of Posterous' recent acquisition by Twitter I've decided to move my blog. For the past few months I've been pondering the idea of building a blog framework with GO and figured this would be a good excuse to finally get around to building it. So here it is!
		</p>
		<p>
			I'll post more about the framework I created (<a href="https://github.com/matt-west/go-blog" title="GO-blog">GO-blog</a>) soon but basically it is really simple and hacker friendly. All of the templates (pages and posts) are stored in memory which makes generating pages really fast. There's no database I just use a JSON dictionary to store information about posts and pages. I'm still working on getting tags up and running.

			I've got go-blog running behind nginx and I'm just using a simple proxy_pass to route requests to the go app.

			All of the code is up on github here: <a href="https://github.com/matt-west/go-blog">https://github.com/matt-west/go-blog</a>.
