		<p>I finished reading this earlier this week and thought that I would just write a few words about the book.</p>
		<p>This book is a very detailed account of Starbucks&rsquo; journey back to greatness. Howard Schultz takes you through the challenges that the company and he faced when trying to turn the company around and restore the culture.</p>
		<p>Overall I thought this book was pretty good and it made some&nbsp;thoroughly&nbsp;enjoyable reading. My favourite thing about the book was the fact that Howard had included the memos and emails sent out to Starbucks staff during the companies transformation. I would&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;recommend this book to anyone that is interested in business or Starbucks.</p>
