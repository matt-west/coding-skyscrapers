		I don't really like writing about myself so I will keep this brief and let you form your own opinions about me.
	<p>
	</p>
		I'm a British web developer and entreprenuer. I was bitten by the entreprenuerial bug at 15 and started selling computer parts online through ebay and a dedicated website. I decided to skip the whole university thing and instead started a web design business (<a href="http://developercity.co.uk" title="Deveoper City">Developer City</a>) after leaving school in '10. Since then I've been lucky enough to work on some really great projects with even better people. I'm currently the CTO of ThisWeeksOffers and Project Manager of <a href="http://simpleinvoices.org" title="Simple Invoices" rel="nofollow">Simple Invoices</a>.

		My most recent endeavour is a new startup (<a href="http://kojilabs.com" title="Koji Labs" rel="nofollow">Koji Labs</a>) which is working on a number of apps for web, mobile and beyond. More on that to come...
